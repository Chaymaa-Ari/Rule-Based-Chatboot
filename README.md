# Project Overview: Rule-Based Chatbot for Data Science

This project involves building a rule-based chatbot specialized in data science and artificial intelligence (AI). The chatbot is designed to provide responses based on predefined patterns and rules, making it suitable for answering basic questions about data science topics. The chatbot is built using Python and NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, and it is integrated with a React frontend through a Flask or FastAPI backend.

The chatbot can handle simple greetings, provide definitions related to AI and data science, and offer some information about tools and roles in the field. However, its responses are limited to the rules defined in the patterns, making it more of a controlled conversational agent than an AI-based chatbot like GPT.
# Technologies Used
<ul>
  <li>React: For the frontend, React is used to build the user interface where users interact with the chatbot.</li>
    <li>FastAPI: This Python framework is used for the backend, where the chatbot logic is implemented and exposed through REST APIs.</li>
    <li>NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): NLTK is used for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and tagging user inputs.</li>
  
</ul>

# Algorithm and Flow

The chatbot operates using a rule-based approach. It uses predefined patterns and responses to match user inputs to specific questions or phrases. If the input matches a pattern, the corresponding response is returned. If no match is found, a generic response is sent back, asking for clarification.

# Key Components:
<ul>
   <li> Pairs: The chatbot's knowledge base consists of pairs of patterns and responses. These patterns are defined using regular expressions (regex), which allows the chatbot to recognize different variations of user inputs.</li>
    <li>Natural Language Processing: NLTK's word_tokenize and pos_tag are used to preprocess user inputs by breaking them into tokens and tagging their parts of speech. The PorterStemmer is used to stem words, which helps in simplifying the comparison of user input with predefined patterns.</li>
</ul>
